### Introduction

The Survey is about gathering user feedback on gaming preferences and interests. You'll find text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus to make sure we cover everything.

### Features

- **Responsive Design**: I made sure that the survey form works great on all devices by using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
- **Input Validation**: lso, I added some basic validation to make sure we get all the necessary info.
- **Styling and UI**: Plus, I gave the form a modern and colorful design with gradient backgrounds and cool hover effects for a more enjoyable user experience.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the survey form is built using semantic HTML5 elements.
- **CSS3**: The form is styled using CSS3, including Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
